# To encrypt the data one system using public key 
# And read that data on another system
# Here are steps given

# Generate private key in .pem format
openssl rsa -in privateKey.key -outform pem > id_rsa.pem

# Generate public key in .pem format
openssl rsa -in id_rsa.pem -pubout -outform pem > id_rsa.pub.pem

# Create a random key using command
openssl rand -base64 32 > key.bin

# Encrypt the key using public key
openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey id_rsa.pub.pem -pubin -in key.bin -out key.bin.enc

# Let's assume the data.txt has the data you want to encrypt

# Encrypt the data
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in data.txt -out data.txt.enc -pass file:./key.bin

# Assuming the receiver party has private key, send encrypted key (key.bin.enc), and data.txt.enc

# Decrypt the key using command
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey id_rsa.pem -in key.bin.enc -out key.bin

# Decrypt the data using command
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in  data.txt.enc -out data.txt -pass file:./key.bin

# Voila!
