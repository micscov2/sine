# Steps for encrypting/decrypting the data
# But before that some OpenSSL basic

# CSR - Certificate Signing Request
# There are various formats for certs like .pem, .der
# And there are some other things also like format PCSK etc

# The below command will generate self-signed certificate
# Which means self private key is used to sign the certificate

openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privateKey.key -out certificate.crt
# Here privateKey.key is private key 
# certificate.crt is signed certificate
# Observe in this case we don't have CSR as we are our own CA

# You will be prompted to give information in following fields
--> FILE1.TXT

# You can check the content generated in 
--> privateKey.key
--> certificate.crt

# Check the content of certificate in somewhat readable form using command
openssl rsa -in certificate.crt -text -noout

# Certificate in general stores public key, and some other data
# Self signed certificate is signed by private key
# Format .der is ASN.1 DER-encoded representation of certificate or key file
# .pem stands for Privacy Enhanced Mail, a Base-64 encoded representation of the
# DER-encoded certificate with header and footer
# CSR is Certificate Signing Request which is given to CA to sign it
# To check which SSL version is being used by some site
opensll s_client -connect <some_url>:443 -ssl2
