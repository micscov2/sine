 JMeter
----------

After long await, I'm done with understanding jmeter for basic web testing.

There are 2 modes in JMeter, GUI and non-GUI mode. The catch is for writing 
scripts anyway you have to use GUI mode. I didn't see how to use the GUI m-
ode script in non-GUI mode, but shouldn't be much difficult.

One of the way to get started with JMeter is to use something called templ-
ate. Select 'Building a web test plan' from 'Templates' option. A new  test
plan will be created. 

In that test plan you can add Sampler, Assertions, Backend Listeners etc.S-
ampler is actual HTTP request. It contains parameters like URL, port, path,
etc. Assertion is how you check if response you got from  webserver. Backe-
nd Listeners is to create reports from results obtained. 

Results obtained in csv format:
timeStamp,elapsed,label,responseCode,responseMessage,threadName,dataType,success,failureMessage,bytes,sentBytes,grpThreads,allThreads,URL,Latency,IdleTime,Connect

PS:
Thread Group - Using it we configure the number of parallel connections (users),
how many times to repeat the actions etc.
