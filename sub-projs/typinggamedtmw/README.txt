Notes:
1. It runs on WAMP (Windows Apache Mysql Php) stack
2. Database can be created by running schema.sql manually.
3. TBD.. (other approach of db creation)

The name of database is
typeddb

We need 5 tables
1. users
2. words
3. top_twenty
4. User specific scores table will be created on sign up
5. [v2.0] Should display top users from last 24 hours

It contains initial set of words (85) insertion queries which can be increased later 
These queries should be run after running of schema.sql
